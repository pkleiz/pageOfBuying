# pageOfBuying
This project is a funcional page where you can choose the options related to buying shirts.

All fields are automatically updated when clicked.

all behaviors were made with JQUERY and  Vanilla Javascript sometimes.

PS: The spinner loader on screen simulates an access in a external DB or something similar, if you want to turn off this, you only need to put "$(".refresh-loader").css("display", "none"); outside of setTimeout.

For the design was used SASS to facilite the compatibility and Bootstrap for the modal window. To finish, the interrogation button was origined from fontawesome.

Thank you for reading and if there are any problem, please contact me.
